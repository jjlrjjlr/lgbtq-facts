## Gender Affirming Care

#### The Amsterdam Cohort of Gender Dysphoria Study (1972-2015): Trends in Prevalence, Treatment, and Regrets
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29463477/

> 6,793 people (4,432 birth-assigned male, 2,361 birth-assigned female) visited our gender identity clinic from 1972 through 2015.

> The percentage of people who underwent gonadectomy within 5 years after starting HT remained stable over time (74.7% of transwomen and 83.8% of transmen). Only 0.6% of transwomen and 0.3% of transmen who underwent gonadectomy were identified as experiencing regret.

> The number of people with gender identity issues seeking professional help increased dramatically in recent decades. The percentage of people who regretted gonadectomy remained small and did not show a tendency to increase.

#### Mental Health Outcomes in Transgender and Nonbinary Youths Receiving Gender-Affirming Care

> This study found that gender-affirming medical interventions were associated with lower odds of depression and suicidality over 12 months. These data add to existing evidence suggesting that gender-affirming care may be associated with improved well-being among TNB youths over a short period, which is important given mental health disparities experienced by this population, particularly the high levels of self-harm and suicide.

> In a prospective cohort study of 104 such youth, those who initiated puberty blockers and gender-affirming hormones had a 73% lower odds of suicidality versus youth who didn't have any gender-affirming treatments (adjusted OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11-0.65), reported Diana M. Tordoff, MPH, of the University of Washington in Seattle, and colleagues.

#### Politicians should follow the science on gender-affirmation treatments

> The peer-reviewed research suggests that transgender children and youth who are treated with affirmation and receive evidence-based treatments tend to see improvements in their psychological wellbeing.

> After they received gender-affirming medical care in early adulthood, the participants demonstrated improved psychological functioning and their sense of wellbeing was similar to or better than that of their peers in the general population, the researchers found.

> The research showed that after treatment, the participants demonstrated both an increase in general wellbeing and a decrease in suicidal thoughts.

> After gender reassignment, in young adulthood, the GD was alleviated and psychological functioning had steadily improved. Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.

#### Puberty suppression in adolescents with gender identity disorder: a prospective follow-up study

> Behavioral and emotional problems and depressive symptoms decreased, while general functioning improved significantly during puberty suppression. Feelings of anxiety and anger did not change between T0 and T1.

#### What Are Puberty Blockers, and How Do They Work?

> These medications are well studied and have been used safely since the late 1980s to pause puberty in adolescents with gender dysphoria. They have been used routinely for even longer in children who enter puberty too early and in adults with a range of other medical conditions.

> A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine, for example, showed that hormone therapy significantly decreased symptoms of depression and anxiety in transgender youth. Another study found that transgender teenagers who received gender-affirming care were 73 percent less likely to self-harm or have suicidal thoughts than those who didn’t.

> Medication that pauses puberty, specifically, has the power to prevent a mental health crisis, making the treatment a “profoundly meaningful intervention” for a young person and their family, says Meredithe McNamara, an adolescent medicine physician at the Yale School of Medicine.

> Gender-affirming surgeries are not common among those under age 18 and are usually limited to “top surgery,” or a mastectomy. Breast reduction surgery is also one of the most common forms of plastic surgery in cisgender teenagers.

> Transgender people—especially transgender women—are more likely to have lower bone density, whether or not they used puberty blockers. This is potentially because of the social stressors of being transgender, such as social isolation, exclusion from some physical activities and a high prevalence of restrictive eating.

> This host of beneficial clinical uses and data, stretching back to the 1960s, shows that puberty blockers are not an experimental treatment, as they are sometimes mischaracterized, says Simona Giordano, a bioethicist at the University of Manchester in England.

#### Association Between Gender-Affirming Surgeries and Mental Health Outcomes
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2779429

> In this study, we demonstrate that undergoing gender-affirming surgery is associated with decreased odds of past-month severe psychological distress, past-year smoking, and past-year suicidal ideation. The post hoc analysis stratifying by degree of surgical affirmation demonstrates that TGD people who underwent all desired surgeries had significantly lower odds of all adverse mental health outcomes, and these benefits were stronger than among TGD people who only received some desired surgeries.

> The observed associations between gender-affirming surgery, psychological distress, and suicide risk reinforce previous small-sample studies suggesting that gender-affirming surgery improves mental health and quality of life among TGD people.

> In our primary analysis, although gender-affirming surgery was associated with lower odds of past-year suicidal ideation, there was no statistically significant association between gender-affirming surgeries and past-year suicide attempts. However, in a post hoc analysis respondents who underwent all desired gender-affirming surgeries had significantly lower odds of past-year suicide attempts.
