#### Myths and Facts: Battling Disinformation About Transgender Rights
https://www.hrc.org/resources/myths-and-facts-battling-disinformation-about-transgender-rights

> Once a transgender youth reaches puberty, a doctor may prescribe them with reversible puberty blockers to safely delay the effects of puberty. Puberty blockers are not “experimental” treatments, but FDA approved medications that have been used to treat precocious puberty in non-transgender children for several decades.

> The World Professional Association of Transgender Health’s handbook, that doctors and clinicians use to socially, psychologically and medically treat transgender youth, states that irreversible genital surgeries should not be carried out until the individual is of legal age to consent to any procedure. This approach is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Osteopathic Pediatricians.

> Some lawmakers cite a case in Connecticut, where an anti-transgender group filed a lawsuit on behalf of three non-transgender girl athletes who claimed racing against transgender athletes was unfair. However, within 10 days of the lawsuit being filed, one of the plaintiffs beat her transgender competitor twice in races for state titles. A federal judge later dismissed the case.

> Opponents of LGBTQ+ equality have admitted that their bathroom safety argument was contrived and not a real concern based on habits of actual predators. It is important to remember that anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups used similar “predator” stereotypes against gay people as recently as the nineties and early two-thousands.

#### Transgender people over four times more likely than cisgender people to be victims of violent crime

#### The CDC's Rape Numbers Are Misleading
https://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers/

> In other words, if being made to penetrate someone was counted as rape—and why shouldn’t it be?—then the headlines could have focused on a truly sensational CDC finding: that women rape men as often as men rape women.

> The CDC also reports that men account for over a third of those experiencing another form of sexual violence—“sexual coercion.” That was defined as being pressured into sexual activity by psychological means: lies or false promises, threats to end a relationship or spread negative gossip, or “making repeated requests” for sex and expressing unhappiness at being turned down.

#### Fact Check-Majority of US mass shooters are cis men, not transgender or non-binary people

> The Gun Violence Archive, which began collecting data on gun violence in the U.S. in 2013, recorded more than 4,400 mass shootings in the last decade, Executive Director Mark Bryant told Reuters via email. Its definition of mass shooting is four or more people shot resulting in injury or death (excluding the perpetrator). Of those, “the number of known suspects in mass shootings which are trans is under 10 for the last decade,” which translated to “1:880 [or 0.11%] of the 4,400 shootings” they recorded, he said.

#### The Understudied Female Sexual Predator
https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/

> For years, the FBI definition of rape was gendered, requiring “carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will.” But a recent redefinition focused instead on forced penetration with no mention of gender. Meanwhile, other data-gatherers had started to track a new category of sexual violence that the Centers for Disease Control call “being forced to penetrate.”

#### FACT FOCUS: No ‘incredible rise’ in transgender shooters
https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-transgender-nashville-shooting-misinformation-cd62492d066d41e820c138256570978c

> Mass casualty shootings perpetrated by someone identifying as trans or nonbinary are rare, and in fact, those groups are far more likely to be the victims of violence.

> While specific data on transgender and nonbinary mass shooters can be hard to isolate, available information shows that the overwhelming majority of assailants in mass shootings are cisgender males.

> Laura Dugan, a professor of human security and sociology at Ohio State University, said the four widely cited examples out of the 3,561 shootings translates to 0.11% being perpetrated by someone who is not cisgender — a very low number relative to the number of mass shootings total.

#### Four Myths About Trans Athletes, Debunked
https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/four-myths-about-trans-athletes-debunked

> Excluding women who are trans hurts all women. It invites gender policing that could subject any woman to invasive tests or accusations of being “too masculine” or “too good” at their sport to be a “real” woman.

> On the other hand, including trans athletes will promote values of non-discrimination and inclusion among all student athletes. As longtime coach and sports policy expert Helen Carroll explains, efforts to exclude subsets of girls from sports, “can undermine team unity and also encourage divisiveness by policing who is ‘really’ a girl.”

> In Connecticut, where cisgender girl runners have tried to block Andraya from participating in the sport she loves, the very same cis girls who have claimed that trans athletes have an “unfair” advantage have consistently performed as well as or better than transgender competitors.

> According to Dr. Deanna Adkins, excluding trans athletes can be deeply harmful and disruptive to treatment. “I know from experience with my patients that it can be extremely harmful for a transgender young person to be excluded from the team consistent with their gender identity.”

> Trans people have the same right to play sports as anybody else. “For the past nine years,” explains Carroll, “transgender athletes have been able to compete on teams at NCAA member collegiates and universities consistent with their gender identity like all other student-athletes with no disruption to women’s collegiate sports.”

#### Gender Diverse Offenders with a History of Sexual Offending
https://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/research/005008-r442_O-en.shtml

> Over 80% of gender diverse offenders with sexual offence histories were trans-women. Sexual offending indicators showed that the majority of these offences were committed while living as their biological sex, and that the highest proportion of victims were children or female.

> Most of these offenders also had a history of abuse and trauma.
