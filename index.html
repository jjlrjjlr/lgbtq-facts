<p>These medications are well studied and have been used safely since
the late 1980s to pause puberty in adolescents with gender dysphoria.
They have been used routinely for even longer in children who enter
puberty too early and in adults with a range of other medical
conditions.</p>

<p>A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine, for example,
showed that hormone therapy significantly decreased symptoms of
depression and anxiety in transgender youth. Another study found that
transgender teenagers who received gender-affirming care were 73 percent
less likely to self-harm or have suicidal thoughts than those who
didn’t.</p>

<p>Medication that pauses puberty, specifically, has the power to
prevent a mental health crisis, making the treatment a “profoundly
meaningful intervention” for a young person and their family, says
Meredithe McNamara, an adolescent medicine physician at the Yale School

reduction surgery is also one of the most common forms of plastic

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Transgender people—especially transgender women—are more likely to
have lower bone density, whether or not they used puberty blockers. This
is potentially because of the social stressors of being transgender,
such as social isolation, exclusion from some physical activities and a
high prevalence of restrictive eating.</p>

<p>In this study, we demonstrate that undergoing gender-affirming
surgery is associated with decreased odds of past-month severe
psychological distress, past-year smoking, and past-year suicidal
ideation. The post hoc analysis stratifying by degree of surgical
affirmation demonstrates that TGD people who underwent all desired
surgeries had significantly lower odds of all adverse mental health
outcomes, and these benefits were stronger than among TGD people who
only received some desired surgeries.</p>

psychological distress, and suicide risk reinforce previous small-sample
studies suggesting that gender-affirming surgery improves mental health
and quality of life among TGD people.</p>

<p>In our primary analysis, although gender-affirming surgery was
associated with lower odds of past-year suicidal ideation, there was no
statistically significant association between gender-affirming surgeries

respondents who underwent all desired gender-affirming surgeries had
significantly lower odds of past-year suicide attempts.</p>

whether sex reassignment decreases (which is likely) or increases (which
is unlikely) that risk.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once a transgender youth reaches puberty, a doctor may prescribe them
with reversible puberty blockers to safely delay the effects of puberty.
Puberty blockers are not “experimental” treatments, but FDA approved
medications that have been used to treat precocious puberty in
non-transgender children for several decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The World Professional Association of Transgender Health’s handbook,
that doctors and clinicians use to socially, psychologically and
medically treat transgender youth, states that irreversible genital
surgeries should not be carried out until the individual is of legal age
to consent to any procedure. This approach is supported by the American
Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Osteopathic
Pediatricians.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some lawmakers cite a case in Connecticut, where an anti-transgender
group filed a lawsuit on behalf of three non-transgender girl athletes
who claimed racing against transgender athletes was unfair. However,
within 10 days of the lawsuit being filed, one of the plaintiffs beat
her transgender competitor twice in races for state titles. A federal
judge later dismissed the case.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Opponents of LGBTQ+ equality have admitted that their bathroom safety
argument was contrived and not a real concern based on habits of actual
predators. It is important to remember that anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups used
similar “predator” stereotypes against gay people as recently as the
nineties and early two-thousands.</p>

injury or death (excluding the perpetrator). Of those, “the number of

Athletes, Debunked</h4>
<p>https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/four-myths-about-trans-athletes-debunked</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Excluding women who are trans hurts all women. It invites gender
policing that could subject any woman to invasive tests or accusations
of being “too masculine” or “too good” at their sport to be a “real”
woman.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, including trans athletes will promote values of
non-discrimination and inclusion among all student athletes. As longtime
coach and sports policy expert Helen Carroll explains, efforts to
exclude subsets of girls from sports, “can undermine team unity and also
encourage divisiveness by policing who is ‘really’ a girl.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In Connecticut, where cisgender girl runners have tried to block
Andraya from participating in the sport she loves, the very same cis
girls who have claimed that trans athletes have an “unfair” advantage
have consistently performed as well as or better than transgender
competitors.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Dr. Deanna Adkins, excluding trans athletes can be
deeply harmful and disruptive to treatment. “I know from experience with
my patients that it can be extremely harmful for a transgender young
person to be excluded from the team consistent with their gender
identity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Trans people have the same right to play sports as anybody else. “For
the past nine years,” explains Carroll, “transgender athletes have been
able to compete on teams at NCAA member collegiates and universities
consistent with their gender identity like all other student-athletes
with no disruption to women’s collegiate sports.”</p>
